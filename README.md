# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

This game is a "frogger-style" web based arcade game. The game engine, html, and resources were provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) as part of their [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The code in app.js was provided by myself. 

## How to start the game
This is a web based game and will start automatically as soon as you launch index.html. 
1. Clone or download the repository on github here: [https://github.com/rlfuller/frogger](https://github.com/rlfuller/frogger)
2. Open the index.html file in a browser

## How to play the game
The game will start immediately upon loading index.html. The object of the game is to move the player from the grass to the water, avoiding all the enemy bugs. The player can be moved by using your keyboards arrow keys (left, right, up, down). Once the player reaches the water, they will be reset back to the grass. If the player collides with an enemy, the player will be reset back to the grass.
